## Initial Thoughts

to be honest, the readings for websockets were confusing for me. I feel like I definitely need some
in project experience with websockets and Action Cable to get the hang of this thing. Let's hope this
project helps!

## Final Thoughts

This project took a bit longer than expected because I went on vacation in the middle of it but I got a feel for
what was happening with websockets and action cable during this project. I'm going to have to hammer down the
create connection, set up channel, and connect to a client steps. From there I can start playing around more with the
subscribe and unsubscribe methods and more! After this comes the final project so let's hope that it goes well!
